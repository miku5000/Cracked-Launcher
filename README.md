# Minecraft Java Cracked Launcher
Cracked version of the old Minecraft launcher for Raspberry Pi.
This will alow you to play singleplayer Minecraft, and join servers if they are cracked/in offline mode.

## Install
Firstly, you must have Minecraft Java installed from [pi-apps](https://github.com/Botspot/pi-apps)

Run these commands after install:
```
sudo mv /usr/share/minecraftjava/launcher.jar /usr/share/minecraftjava/oldlauncher.jar
sudo wget https://github.com/boomerangos/Cracked-Launcher/blob/master/crackedlauncherVer1.1.jar?raw=true -O /usr/share/minecraftjava/launcher.jar
```

Open the MC Java shortcut in the start menu.

The username can be whatever you want, and the password is "raspberry"
